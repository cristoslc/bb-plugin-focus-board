| Step | Result | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| On a phone viewport the pane opens over the board (the full-screen sheet) | pass | ✓ pane shows thr_uat_queue |
| The compact header's actions menu carries Full Screen (the standalone button is dropped on compact) | pass | ✓ text visible: "Full Screen" |
| Choosing Full Screen runs the maximize path; the mock's navigation is a no-op so the pane stays | pass | ✓ pane shows thr_uat_queue; ✓ no refusal banner |
